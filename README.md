- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ishaaq92
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my programming skills so I can build things that Muslims in the UK can benefit from.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI so that I can build a Events-map App to help Mosques in London create and manage their events and allow attendees to easily see when the next lesson or lecture is.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my Event-map App because I am having to learn most of it myself. I need someone who is an experienced Swift developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Connect with me on linkedIn and say you came from from my Github. Here's the link: https://beacons.ai/ishaaq92

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am grateful you took your time out to read this :)
