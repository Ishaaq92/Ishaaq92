- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ishaaq92
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my programming skills so I can build things that Muslims in the UK can benefit from.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning low level programming in C as part of my studies at 42 London. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects soon. Hoping to meet more ambitious Muslims to build a startup.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Connect with me on linkedIn and say you came from from my Github. Here's the link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaaq-ahmed-526125263/

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am building an influencer marketing agency.
